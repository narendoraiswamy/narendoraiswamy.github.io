Abstract:

Conventional few-shot segmentation methods learn object segmentation from a few labelled support images with strongly labelled segmentation masks. Recent work has shown to perform on par with weaker levels of supervision in terms of scribbles and bounding boxes. To the best of our knowledge there has not been any work on few-shot object segmentation with image-level supervision only. We propose a novel setup that is based on image-level supervision which we call one-shot webly supervised object segmentation. Different variants that act as strong baselines are proposed to learn from an image-level labelled support set. We propose a multi-modal interaction module that utilizesconditioningandattentionmechanisms. Itenablesour model to achieve on par performance with the state of the artmethodswiththeleastpossiblesupervisiononPASCAL5i one-shot segmentation benchmark. We further showcase our method to work along with web data indicating the scalability of our proposed method. Web-supervision ”webly” is considered as a promising direction toward learning few-shot object segmentation in a cost efﬁcient manner. Our method differs from conventional webly supervised semantic segmentation since it does not require to re-train on large-scale web data with each novel class
