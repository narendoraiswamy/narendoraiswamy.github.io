I am a research assistant at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in/) where I work under the supervision of [Prof. Soma Biswas](http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/new/people/faculty/soma.biswas/index.html). In my year and a half experience as a junior researcher here, I have extensively worked on semantic segmentation, learning with scarce data and developing hardware efficient deep learning models. I have also dabbled a bit with zero shot learning and incremental learning to a certain extent.

I actively collaborate with Ph.D students from University of Alberta and research scientists from Element AI and Google. I am currently working on proposing a novel few shot setup for instance segmentation. In another project, I am working on developing a methodology for semi supervised domain adaptation using self training and overcoming the class imbalance problem in unsupervised domain adaptation.

My research interests lies in Machine learning and Computer vision, especially on learning with scarce data, weakly supervised learning and self-supervision methods along with its applications on the multi-task and meta learning algorithms. I am also open to other areas of research as well.

Prior to this, I was an Associate Software Engineer in [Robert Bosch](https://www.bosch.in/) where I worked on applying statistical machine learning algorithms to develop component models for vehicle modelling software(VeMoX). Previously, I have interned in the student satellite program from [ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in/) where I worked on developing an attitude determination algorithm using Extended Kalman filters. 


**News**:

Our paper on few-shot object segmentation is accepted at ICLR PML4DC 2020 workshop.
