I am a research assistant at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in/) where I work under the supervision of [Prof. Soma Biswas](http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/new/people/faculty/soma.biswas/index.html) on few shot/zero shot methodologies and Semantic segmentation. The experience that I gathered here led me to collaborations with people from University of Alberta, Google and Element.ai. I am currently working on proposing a novel few shot setup for semantic segmentation. In another project, I am working on a methodology for zero shot semantic segmentation. 

My research interests lies in the intersection of Machine learning and Compueter vision, especially on learning with scarce data, weakly supervised learning and geometrical approaches towards vision.  

Prior to this, I was an Associate Software Engineer in [Robert Bosch](https://www.bosch.in/) where I worked on applying statistical machine learning algorithms to develop component models for vehicle modelling software(VeMoX). I have interned in the student satellite program from [ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in/) where I worked in developing an altitude determination algoorithm using Extended Kalman filters.
