I am currently a Research Associate and lecturer at the University of Michigan. I graduated from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2023 and I was fortunate to be advised by [Stella X. Yu](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~stellayu/index.html). I am broadly interested in machine learning with applications in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

Over the past 2 years, I have developed a passion for seeing research from its initial conception to eventual deployable application. In this process, I have extensively learnt developing custom CUDA kernels, LLM optimization, inference and distributed training techniques and a bit of MLOps along the way. On the pure research side, I am currently enthusiastic about post-training diffusion models with human feedback. I'm excited to develop better controllability and alignment of multi-modal models in the coming years. I have also explored techniques for the emerging learning capabilities of Large language models (In-Context learning) and adapting diffusion models for dense prediction tasks and eliciting adversarial robustness. 

As a lecturer, I have developed a new Advanced Deep Learning course covering the advent of LLMs. Prior to joining UMich, I was a junior researcher at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in/) where I got to extensively work on meta-learning, active & self-supervised learning, domain adaptation and dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation.

Before my stint at IISc, I was a Software Engineer in [Robert Bosch](https://www.bosch.in/) where I worked on applying statistical machine learning algorithms to develop component models for vehicle modelling software(VeMoX). In undergrad, I interned in the student satellite program from [ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in/) where I worked on developing an attitude determination algorithm using Extended Kalman filters. 

I enjoy long treks, music from Pink Floyd and Odesza, learning about behavioural economics, psychology and exploring financial markets. I am an AI researcher by day and a geo-political analyst by night. An avid enthusiast of life, MMA, and F1:) 

I am open to research collaborations. Hit me up to discuss and collaborate on potential research problems!
