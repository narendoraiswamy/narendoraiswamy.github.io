I am a researcher at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in/). My research interests lies in Machine learning and Computer vision. In over two years of my experience as a junior researcher here, I have extensively worked on semantic segmentation, learning with few labeled data, domain adaptation, active learning and developing hardware efficient deep learning models.

I actively collaborate with Ph.D students from University of Alberta and research scientists from Element AI and Google. I am currently working on proposing efficient algorithms for semi-supervised and universal domain adaptation methods.

Prior to this, I was an Associate Software Engineer in [Robert Bosch](https://www.bosch.in/) where I worked on applying statistical machine learning algorithms to develop component models for vehicle modelling software(VeMoX). Previously, I have interned in the student satellite program from [ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in/) where I worked on developing an attitude determination algorithm using Extended Kalman filters. 

During my free time, I trek and read about economics and financial markets.
